                <p>
                    I don't understand why you blame me<br>
                    Take me as I am, it's the same me<br>
                    Yeah<br>
                    Senseless sight to see<br>
                    Yeah<br>
                    Senseless sight to see<br>
                    Ayy<br>
                    <br>
                    Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG<br>
                    And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosy<br>
                    Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see<br>
                    I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me<br>
                    I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me<br>
                    Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me<br>
                    And I show my face in a case so you know it's me<br>
                    Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me<br>
                    And I'm too about it<br>
                    And the dirt that they threw on my name<br>
                    Turned to soil and I grew up out it<br>
                    Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it<br>
                    Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm outside, 29, G5, seaside<br>
                    I been losin' friends and findin' peace<br>
                    But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me<br>
                    If I ever heard one and I'm still here<br>
                    Outside, frontline, Southside<br>
                    I've been losin' friends and findin' peace<br>
                    Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me<br>
                    <br>
                    Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party<br>
                    Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started<br>
                    I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody<br>
                    I can never love her, she a busy body<br>
                    Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah<br>
                    Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah<br>
                    I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah<br>
                    You know that, it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah<br>
                    <br>
                    Momma used to be on disability but gave this ability<br>
                    And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight<br>
                    I don't think you feelin', I'm out here<br>
                    Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be<br>
                    I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be<br>
                    I still see you at the top and they misunderstood me<br>
                    I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity<br>
                    And we don't keep on us anymore, it's with security<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm outside (yeah), 29 (yeah), G5, seaside<br>
                    I've been losin' friends and findin' peace<br>
                    But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me<br>
                    If I ever heard one and I'm still here<br>
                    Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)<br>
                    I've been losin' friends and findin' peace<br>
                    Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me<br>
                    <br>
                    I don't understand why you blame me<br>
                    Take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm trying)<br>
                    Senseless sight to see<br>
                    Senseless sight to see (Outside)<br>
                    <br>
                    Rollin' in a Rolls and ain't no saftey<br>
                    Ridin', engine revvin'<br>
                    Gotta roll over to you gotta get my release<br>
                    Spread your legs downtown as I'm going out to eat<br>
                    You can hear the raw sounds when it rock up in your sleep<br>
                    I'ma roll on her 'fore I let her roll on me<br>
                    Split this one down the middle, wake up in a harmony (sick)<br>
                    <br>
                    Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (sick, sick)<br>
                    It's just a worryin', I'd rather bury them<br>
                    I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (yeah)<br>
                    Early morning, shoulder rubs and lawyer signed the settlement<br>
                    I'm never settling this shit get darker then my melanin<br>
                    At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in<br>
                    Scrolling through my call log by emojis how I'm saving 'em<br>
                    <br>
                    Del Mar as the beach where my hoe was but I favorite them<br>
                    That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies dem<br>
                    Backwood in your face, won't push away, he got the K on him<br>
                    I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (break it)<br>
                    They sent a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town<br>
                    Know they position, you know ass up with the face down (let's go)<br>
                    <br>

                    I'm make an expense, to me it's just sense<br>
                    I'm droppin' the top, no tint for the whip<br>
                    I'm dropping the top 'cause bro tried to spin<br>
                    She dropping the top she back again<br>
                    Fuck her 'cause she at the crib again, company<br>
                    <br>
                    I let it slide when I really should slid<br>
                    After all the shit I did<br>
