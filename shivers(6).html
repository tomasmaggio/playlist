                <p>
                    took an arrow to the heart<br>
                    I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours<br>
                    Strawberries and somethin' more<br>
                    Ooh yeah, I want it all<br>
                    Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)<br>
                    Fill up the engine, we can drive real far<br>
                    Go dancin' underneath the stars<br>
                    Ooh yeah, I want it all<br>
                    Mm, you got me feelin' like<br>
                    <br>
                    I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes<br>
                    I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm<br>
                    Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night<br>
                    Yeah, you got me singin' like<br>
                    <br>
                    Ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
                    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
                    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
                    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
                    And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
                    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
                    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
                    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
                    <br>
                    Into the car<br>
                    On the backseat in the moonlit dark<br>
                    Wrap me up between your legs and arms<br>
                    Ooh, I can't get enough<br>
                    You know you could tear me apart (ooh)<br>
                    Put me back together and take my heart<br>
                    I never thought that I could love this hard<br>
                    Ooh, I can't get enough<br>
                    Mm, you got me feeling like<br>
                    <br>
                    I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes<br>
                    I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm<br>
                    Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night<br>
                    Yeah, you got me singin' like<br>

                    Baby, you burn so hot<br>
                    You make me shiver with the fire you got<br>
                    This thing we started, I don't want it to stop<br>
                    You know you make me shiver-er-er<br>
                    Baby, you burn so hot<br>
                    You make me shiver with the fire you got<br>
