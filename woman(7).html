Hey, woman<br>
Hey, woman<br>
<br>
Hey, woman<br>
Let me be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
I can be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
Let me be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
I can be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>

What you need?<br>
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed<br>
She can grow it from her womb, a family<br>
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see<br>
You can reciprocate<br>
I got delicious taste<br>
You need a woman's touch in your place<br>
Just protect her and keep her safe<br>
Baby, worship my hips and waist<br>
So feminine with grace<br>
I touch your soul when you hear me say<br>
"Boy, let me be your woman"<br>
<br>
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman<br>
I can be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
Let me be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
I can be your woman<br>
Woman, woman, woman<br>
<br>
I can be your lady, I'm a woman<br>
I'm a motherfucker but they got a problem<br>
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama<br>
Put that paper in the picture, like a diorama<br>
Gotta face a lot people that are opposite<br>
'Cause the world told me we ain't got that common sense<br>
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit<br>
And you will never know a God, without a Goddess<br>
As honest as fuckin' honest get<br>
And I could be on everything<br>
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states<br>
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty<br>
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty<br>
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl<br>
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl<br>
They wanna pit us against each other when we succeedin' for no reasons<br>
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls<br>
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (yeah)<br>
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (nah)<br>
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top<br>
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (why?)<br>
<br>
Woman (daddy)<br>
Let me be your woman (let me be your)<br>
Woman, woman, woman (I need to be your) (daddy)<br>
I can be your woman (I know)<br>
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)<br>
Let me be your woman (I know)<br>
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)<br>
I can be your woman (I know)<br>
Woman, woman, woman <br>
