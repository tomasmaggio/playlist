                <p>I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                    I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
                    Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (oh)<br>
                <br>
                
                I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
                    I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
                    I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
                    Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
                <br>
                Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
                    Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
                    Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
                    Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
                <br>
                I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                    I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
                    Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
                    I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
                    I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could<br>
                    Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
                    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
                    <br>
                When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh-ooh)<br>
                    You're the reason I believe in love<br>
                    It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh)<br>
                    And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
                    Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
                    'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed<br>
                    And you know that I know that I can't live without you<br>
                    So, baby, stay
                    <br>
