                Road shimmer<br>
                Wiggling the vision<br>
                Heat heat waves<br>
                I'm swimming in a mirror<br>
                <br>
                Road shimmer<br>
                Wiggling the vision<br>
                Heat heat waves<br>
                I'm swimming in a<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
                Late nights in the middle of June<br>
                Heat waves been faking me out<br>
                Can't make you happier now<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
                Late nights in the middle of June<br>
                Heat waves been faking me out<br>
                Can't make you happier now<br>
                <br>
                Usually I put<br>
                Something on TV<br>
                So we never think<br>
                About you and me<br>
                <br>
                But today I see<br>
                Our reflections<br>
                Clearly in Hollywood<br>
                Laying on the screen<br>
                <br>
                You just need a better life than this<br>
                You need something I can never give<br>
                Fake water all across the road<br>
                It's gone now the night has come but<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
                Late nights in the middle of June<br>
                Heat waves been faking me out<br>
                Can't make you happier now<br>
                <br>
                You can't fight it<br>
                You can't breathe<br>
                You say something so loving but<br>
                Now I've got to let you go<br>
                You'll be better off in someone new<br>
                I don't wanna be alone<br>
                You know it hurts me too<br>
                <br>
                You look so broken when you cry<br>
                One more and then I'll say goodbye<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
                Late nights in the middle of June<br>

                <br>
                I just wonder what you're dreaming of<br>
                When you sleep and smile so comfortable<br>
                I just wish that I could give you that<br>
                That look that's perfectly un-sad<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
