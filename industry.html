                    Then I went did it again, yeah<br>
                    <br>
                    I told you long ago, on the road<br>
                    I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)<br>
                    I don't run from nothin', dog<br>
                    Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low<br>
                    (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)<br>
                    You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)<br>

                    <br>
                    My track record so clean<br>
                    They couldn't wait to just bash me<br>
                    I must be gettin' too flashy<br>
                    Y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (woo)<br>
                    It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay<br>
                    And these girls know that I'm nasty (mm)<br>
                    I sent her back to her boyfriend<br>
                    With my handprint on her ass cheek<br>
                    City talkin', we takin' notes<br>
                    Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts<br>
                    Wish he could but he can't get close<br>
                    OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts<br>
                    I'm the type that you can't control<br>
                    Said I would then I made it so (so)<br>
                    I don't clear up rumors (ayy)<br>
                    Where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)<br>
                    I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers<br>
                    Turn my haters to consumers<br>
                    I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)<br>
                    Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (mm)<br>
                    Mine is comin' sooner (mm)<br>
                    I'm just a late bloomer (mm)<br>
                    I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)<br>
                    All these social networks and computers<br>
                    Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers (losers)<br>
                    <br>
                    I told you long ago, on the road<br>
                    I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)<br>
                    I don't run from nothin', dog<br>
                    Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low<br>
                    (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)<br>
                    You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)<br>
